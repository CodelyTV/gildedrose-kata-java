# CodelyTV Gilded Rose kata solution

## Introduction

Solution proposal for the Gilded Rose kata.

Restrictions taken into account:
* We can't modify the `Item` class. However, we can use inheritance or wrappers in order to add or modify its behaviour.  

## How To Start

1. Install Java 8
2. Clone this repository `git clone https://bitbucket.org/codelytv/gildedrose`.
3. Run the tests with `./gradlew test`
4. Start refactoring!
